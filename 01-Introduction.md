> “I say: I beg, tell me also, because fighting is no longer needed, what is the art: the purpose of fencing?”
“He says: your question is quite un-useful. Let fencing be the same as a pastime, but still the art is worthy and fine. 
The art is yet noble, like jousting and tourney, like playing the lute, singing, and flute.”

*Christoff Rösener - 1589*

#Welcome!
Hello and welcome to the wednesday longsword class @ SPIFF! We're all very happy to have you here. The world of historical fencing is vast and interesting, and there are many ways to approach it; This is but one!

## Purpose
The intentions and goals of this resource are several:

* To introduce new fencers to the contents and structure of the wednesday longsword class
* To give a reference to the source material and approach of the class
* To keep a reasonably up-to-date reference archive on drills and games performed in class
* To provide a basis for building up a fencer's tactical acumen, along with troubleshooting their fencing

## Background
The contents of these documents are representations of a work that began in 2019, right before the pandemic. I took a deeper interest in the practice of fencing, as it had been done historically up until today, along with also looking into the research behind motor skills development. I took a serious look at what assumptions I had while doing this class and sought after possible avenues of improvement. Since then, I've worked with other fencers and instructors to deepen my focus and produce the content needed to run the class as it is now. I use the phrase "representations of..." carefully, as this work is still, and always will be, in progress. Ergo, the project is a living one and will always be open for and subject to feedback, new realisations, and new research.
